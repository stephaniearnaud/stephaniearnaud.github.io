                    <h4>Climbing</h4>
                    <p>I started climbing in 2010. When I moved to Poland, a friend of mine, who'd been a passionate climber for years, suggested I come try it. And that, is how I &quot;caught the virus&quot;. If you're reading this and you're a climber yourself then you know what I'm talking about. If you aren't, let me explain: climbing requires a very wide range of skills: both physical and psychological. You have to be precise, balanced, powerful. You need to solve problems with both your mind and body. You have to know yourself and your limits, and yet know there's always a way to dig deep, find that missing millimeter from a foot position, or grab that hold when you thought your fingers had given up. The focus that one must apply while climbing is like meditation. And when the moves are mastered, it's a very graceful dance.</p>

                    <h4>Yoga</h4>
                    <p>Maybe each new destination needs its new fitness challenge. I started yoga in 2012, when I moved to Vietnam. It plays a very important role in my fitness practice: it enhances my performance in other sports, helps me recover, relax and breathe deeply. I have a lot more to say about yoga: I'll keep working on this description while you perfect your headstand.</p>

                    <h4>Water sports</h4>
                    <p>During a short trip to Sydney in 2015, I tried surfing. Briefly, but that was enough time to experience the amazing feeling that comes with intense focus on elements and follows you for the rest of the day. I came home to Saigon and decided I wanted to keep doing it. Turns out, Mui Ne is a beach city in Vietnam that's known as one of the best kitesurfing spots in South-east Asia. I'm still learning at the time of writing this, but I can already stand and ride downwind. Upwind is still a bit of a struggle, but getting there. I'm always up for new challenges, so I've also tried wakeboarding &#91;with boat and cable&#93;.</p>

                    <p>I have played handball for 11 years, which has always made me improve my team spirit along the years.Since June 2013, with a group of other handball fans, we started the 1st expats team in Saigon.

                    <h4>Gymnastics</h4>
                    <p>It's been my first ever sport. I started when I was 4. Unfortunately, it's not one of these sports that you can keep practicing when you're on the move, like running or yoga. It requires specific equipment. That's why I stopped doing it, regretfully. Still, it has taught me a lot and my body and mind still wear the benefits of 12 years of practice. Yes, I can still walk on my hands! Seriously though, I haven't done anything that has pushed my limits and had me fight my fears as much as gymnastics. That very first time when you try a new trick you've never done before is a total step into the unknown. But how fulfilling once you've made it! I find that climbing and gymnastics have and require very similar qualities. Somehow, my climbing+yoga practice has replaced what I was missing from my childhood's sport.</p>
